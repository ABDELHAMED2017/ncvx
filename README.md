# ncvx

NCVX is an extension of CVXPY for solving problems with convex objectives and decision variables from a nonconvex set.
The solver methods provided and the syntax for constructing problems are discussed in [our associated paper](http://stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/ncvx.html).

To install the package, run ``python setup.py install`` in the main folder. The package has CVXPY and munkres as dependencies.
